In this project, I worked on designing a blog site for homework. By creating pages such as the home page and blog post page, and incorporating visual requirements and design add-ons, I elevated my project to a richer and more visually advanced level. This allowed me to practice and enhance my knowledge, particularly in areas such as managing and deleting information.
